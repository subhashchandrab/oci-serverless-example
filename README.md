# OCI Serverless functions
Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. Oracle Cloud Functions is a serverless platform that lets developers create, run, and scale applications without managing any infrastructure. 

In the current use case, we will explore how we can use Oracle Cloud Functions as backend for any web based applications to build the serverless applications.

## Summary
We have a static web page based on plain html with all required javascript/css embedded inside it. This page contains the UI to handle a generic product store which contains various products and their availability(count of available items for each product). The UI contains the following operations
- Fetch all products
- Add a new product to the store
- Update count of an existing product
- Delete an existing product from the store
